This is a static landing page I created for an anime and movie streaming platform as part of my college project. üé•üçø As a beginner in web development, this project was all about learning and experimenting with frontend design. It's not perfect, but every step taught me something new! Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I continue to improve.

Key features:

Clean and simple UI
Responsive design (learning the basics!)
Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any tips, I'd love to hear them! #learninginpublic #webdevelopment"
